## Description

Battle pin is a simple accuracy game in which you must place several needles on the circle without touching any other bits inspirated in AA game. Battle Pin includes an extra mode local-multiplayer. This personal project was made it with Unity3D and C# code language to explore my capacity to make 2D game to Android devices.
